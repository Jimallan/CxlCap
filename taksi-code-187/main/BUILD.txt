BUILD INSTRUCTIONS
==========================================================================

There is a Taksi.SLN file for building in Micrsoft Visual Studio 7.1
There is a Taksi8.SLN file for building in Micrsoft Visual Studio 2005
There is a Taksi9.SLN file for building in Micrsoft Visual Studio 2008

Alternately the (OUT OF DATE, MUST UPDATE) Makefile (in the src folder) is intended to be used by Microsoft NMAKE 
tool, which comes with Visual C++ 6. You will need the following 3rd-party
software to build this program:

1. DirectX 9 SDK 
(Modify the Makefile so that it points to correct location
of the SDK on your disk. Default is \DXSDK9)

2. OpenGL main header file (gl.h)
(Usually is installed in Visual Studio standard location for headers.
If not, modify the Makefile accordingly.)

3. Optional DirectX 8 support
The DirectX 8 SDK has been deprecated and thus not included in the latest
DirectX SDK. However, the entire DirectX 8 SDK is not needed for Taksi to
support DX8.  The only header files that are needed are:
d3d8.h
d3d8caps.h
d3d8types.h
Have those files in your include path and then make sure USE_DIRECTX8 is
defined in stdafx.h (it may be commented out).

Three types of build are supported by the current Makefile: 
"debug", "release", and "perf".

To perform "debug" build, just type "nmake".
To perform "release" build, type "nmake release".
To perform "perf" build, type "nmake perf".

Currently, the difference between "debug" and "release" builds is in the
way the debug configuration parameter is treated. The "release" build
ignores debug values > 1, while "debug" build provides more detailed 
logging for debug > 1. This behaviour, however, may change in the future.

The third type fo build - "perf" - can be used to gather performance
statistics, using CLOCK_START and CLOCK_STOP_AND_LOG macros from log.h

(NOTE: You can also build the EXE and DLL files separately, using 
appropriate targets, specified in the Makefile.)

NOTE: When debugging:

You can use 2 debuggers. One for the Taksi app and one for the target app.
This way you can watch debug messages live from both process spaces.
Attach the debugger to the target task first then run Taksi under the debugger.
good sample target tasks are some of the sample apps that come with DirectX SDK
You can set breakpoints in the target process space and the Taksi.exe process space seperately.

Try using a global debug message monitor like Compuwares Monitor.exe.
