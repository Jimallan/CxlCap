</font><h1><font face="ARIAL,GENEVA,HELVETICA">AVI</font></h1>
<p>

<font face="ARIAL,GENEVA,HELVETICA">AVI (Audio-Video Interleave) is a rather old file format that Microsoft has been trying to 
abandon for years in an attempt to get people to switch to their Windows Media format 
instead. However, the simplicity of AVI and its ubiquity and made it quite popular, so 
AVIs are still widely used.  There are many third-party developers using AVIs, so there is 
a wide array of AVI codecs available.

</font></p><h3><font face="ARIAL,GENEVA,HELVETICA">Microsoft MPEG-4 v2</font></h3>
<font face="ARIAL,GENEVA,HELVETICA">While this codec encodes AVIs, it is actually the ancestor of Microsoft's current 
<a href="http://people.csail.mit.edu/tbuehler/video/codecs/wm.html">Windows Media</a> codecs.  After version three (which was not an AVI codec), the codec 
was renamed to Windows Media 7.  Despite the fact that it is obsolete from a technical 
standpoint, the MS MPEG-4 v2 codec is still widely used because it encodes to AVIs, 
which are generally more convenient than Windows Media files (see the Windows Media 
section for more info).  MS MPEG-4 v2 still gives very good quality and at very small 
sizes.  

</font><p>

<font face="ARIAL,GENEVA,HELVETICA"><b>Quality:</b>  <i>Very Good.</i>  While subsequent Windows Media codecs give better quality, the 
differences can be rather subtle, so the quality given by MS MPEG-4 v2 is usually more 
than adequate for most video sources.  At very low bit rates (under 500 kbps) blockiness 
becomes very noticeable.

</font></p><p>

<font face="ARIAL,GENEVA,HELVETICA"><b>Size:</b>  <i>Excellent.</i>  The file sizes are usually quite small, and are among the smallest of all 
the delivery codecs I tested.

</font></p><p>

<font face="ARIAL,GENEVA,HELVETICA"><b>Compatibility:</b>  <i>Good.</i>  Compatible with most machines running Windows 2000 and XP.  
The codec is available as a free download from Microsoft if needed.

</font></p><p>

<font face="ARIAL,GENEVA,HELVETICA"><b>Usability:</b>  <i>Excellent.</i>  The codec provides adequate control with only three parameters to 
adjust.  Most videos are quite acceptable in terms of quality using just the default settings 
(although file sizes may be larger than they need be).  Encoding is rather fast as well.  
One downside is that it can be tough to estimate what your resultant file size will be, 
since it is a variable bite rate codec and the data rate that is specified is a maximum rate 
(you can't specify an average rate).

</font></p><p>

<font face="ARIAL,GENEVA,HELVETICA"><a name="notmp4"></a>
<b><i>Note:</i></b>  One weird thing is that Microsoft's MPEG-4 is NOT actually MPEG-4!  The 
codecs were developed before the MPEG-4 standard was agreed upon, and Microsoft 
assumed that the MPEG-4 that they developed would be become the standard MPEG-4.  
Well, it didn't, which is the main reason why the codec's name was changed to Windows 
Media in later versions.  

</font></p><p>

<font face="ARIAL,GENEVA,HELVETICA">What does this mean to you?  Right now, pretty much nothing, since there are very, very 
few applications that use standardized MPEG-4 at this time.  For download and web 
distribution, it doesn't matter if the codec is MPEG-4 compliant or not.  However, in the 
rare occasion that you are compressed a video for something that requires compliant 
MPEG-4 video, do NOT use Microsoft's "MPEG-4" codecs.

</font></p><p><font face="ARIAL,GENEVA,HELVETICA"><br>

<a name="divx3"></a>
</font></p><h3><font face="ARIAL,GENEVA,HELVETICA">DivX 3.11:</font></h3><p>

<font face="ARIAL,GENEVA,HELVETICA">Ah, the infamous DivX codec; by far the most notorious and controversial video codec.  
A large subculture of hackers and pirates (Arr!) have formed around it, and it is the source of 
the large amount of misinformation and nonsense about its powers. 

</font></p><p>

<font face="ARIAL,GENEVA,HELVETICA">DivX 3, the most widely used DivX codec, is actually just a hacked version of 
<a href="http://people.csail.mit.edu/tbuehler/video/codecs/wm.html#MS4v3">Microsoft's MPEG-4 v3 codec</a>.  MS MPEG-4 v3 let you only encode to ASF files, yet 
DivX 3 lets you encode to AVI, and adds the ability to compress the audio to MP3.  Since 
this codec was obviously hacked without Microsoft's permission, the codec is technically 
illegal, although still widely used.

</font></p><p>

<font face="ARIAL,GENEVA,HELVETICA">DivX 3 is actually two codecs:  DivX Fast-Motion and DivX Low-Motion, which are 
based on two separate builds of the MS MPEG-4 v3 codec.  The Low-Motion is the more 
widely used codec.

</font></p><p>

<font face="ARIAL,GENEVA,HELVETICA">People often make the claim that DivX 3 is a vast leap in video quality over MS MPEG-4 
v2.  From a technical standpoint, it is indeed a newer revision of the MS MPEG-4 codec, 
so it seems natural that it would be better than v2.  Yet in practice, when the same file is 
encoded in both DivX 3 and MS MPEG-4 v2 using the same settings, in many cases it is 
extremely difficult to tell the difference between the two, in both image quality and file 
size.  In fact, I had to encode many different files before I could create artifacts in one 
video that did not appear in the other, and in each case the artifacts were in the 
supposedly technically superior DivX 3 file (the person who hacked the codec did not 
know what was different between the two builds of the MPEG-4 v3 codec he hacked, so 
its possible they were early builds that differ from the released version).  

</font></p><p><font face="ARIAL,GENEVA,HELVETICA"><br>

</font></p><h3><font face="ARIAL,GENEVA,HELVETICA">DivX 3 Low-Motion</font></h3><p>
<font face="ARIAL,GENEVA,HELVETICA">This codec is usually agreed to be the better of the two DivX 3 codecs, and it was so 
named because it appears to do better in scenes with not a lot of motion, although it is 
also a better performer overall.

</font></p><p>

<font face="ARIAL,GENEVA,HELVETICA"><b>Quality:</b>  <i>Very Good.</i>  A bit better than to MS MPEG-4 v2.

</font></p><p>

<font face="ARIAL,GENEVA,HELVETICA"><b>Size:</b> <i>Excellent.</i>  Again, comparable to MS MPEG-4 v2.

</font></p><p>

<font face="ARIAL,GENEVA,HELVETICA"><b>Compatibility:</b>  <i>Fair</i>.  DivX's weakness is the fact that one has to manually install the 
codec to view content encoded in DivX (obviously, no Windows machine is going to 
come pre-installed with a hacked codec!)

</font></p><p>

<font face="ARIAL,GENEVA,HELVETICA"><b>Usability:</b>  <i>Excellent.</i>Same as MS MPEG-4 v2.


</font></p><p><font face="ARIAL,GENEVA,HELVETICA"><br>

</font></p><h3><font face="ARIAL,GENEVA,HELVETICA">DivX 3 Fast-Motion:</font></h3><p>
<font face="ARIAL,GENEVA,HELVETICA">This codec usually gives better performance than its low-motion brother with video that 
has a lot of action and movement.  However, on the majority of videos, Low-Motion will 
give better results.  If you wish to use DivX 3, use the Low-Motion codec, unless your 
video contains a lot of explosions and car chases.

</font></p><p><font face="ARIAL,GENEVA,HELVETICA"><br>

<b>Why I Don't Recommend You Use DivX.</b>
</font></p><p>

<font face="ARIAL,GENEVA,HELVETICA">Since DivX is so widely known, I often hear from people wanting to use it.  I do not 
recommend you use DivX 3 with any video work that relates to your research or 
professional work, for several reasons:

</font></p><p>

<font face="ARIAL,GENEVA,HELVETICA">1.	<i>It's illegal.</i>  This is pretty much a no-brainer.  While you may not think twice 
about installing a hacked codec, people in your audience might.  If you want 
people to view your video, it's a good rule of thumb to not require that they do 
anything illegal before they can see it.  Also, it looks very unprofessional to use 
hacked software.  If you are applying for industry jobs, you don't want to direct 
them to a web site filed with DivX files (especially if you're applying to 
Microsoft!)

</font></p><p>

<font face="ARIAL,GENEVA,HELVETICA">2.	<i>Stigma.</i>  This is related to point one.  In addition to being illegal, DivX is 
associated with pirated movies and porn, so there is a stigma that is attached to 
even the later legal versions of DivX.  How your audience views DivX depends 
on who there are.  I know that in the video community DivX is looked down 
upon, and a good way to paint yourself as an amateur is to use DivX.  This may 
differ among mainly computer people, but when most people think of DivX, they 
don't think of serious research.

</font></p><p>

<font face="ARIAL,GENEVA,HELVETICA">3.	<i>Instability.</i>  DivX and its associated utilities were not written by professionals, 
and installing them can have unpredictable results.  This is especially true with 
video software, with whom DivX does not always play well with.  In just my 
personal experience, I have seen DivX codecs overwrite other codecs without 
prompting, cause Premiere to crash immediately upon startup, and even in one 
case a DivX bundle disabled the Firewire drivers.  It doesn't happen on all 
machines, but its happened enough to me for me to be very wary.  Since by 
encoding in DivX you are requiring your audience to install the codec, it is 
possible that the codec will wreck havoc with their machines, after which they 
will hardly be predisposed to view your video favorably.  

</font></p><p>

<font face="ARIAL,GENEVA,HELVETICA">All of these reasons have nothing to do with the technical attributes of DivX, but rather 
how people will view your work if it is encoded in DivX.  While you may only care 
about how good the quality is and how small the file sizes are, other factors besides 
image quality affect a person's judgment and reaction to your video.  Remember that you 
are distributing this video so it can be seen by and impress the largest audience possible.  
The best codec from a technical standpoint may not be the best in accomplishing this 
goal.

</font></p><p><font face="ARIAL,GENEVA,HELVETICA"><br>

<a name="divx5"></a>
</font></p><h3><font face="ARIAL,GENEVA,HELVETICA">DivX 5.0.2</font></h3><p>
<font face="ARIAL,GENEVA,HELVETICA">The DivX 4 codec was written entirely from scratch and did not use any code from the 
illegal, hacked, DivX 3 codec, making the codec entirely legal.  However, it also wasn't 
as good as DivX 3.  DivX 4 (now considered a legacy codec), has been replaced by DivX 
5, which is a substantial improvement (although the claim on the DivX website that DivX 
5 is "the most advanced video technology in the world" is absolutely ridiculous).

</font></p><p><font face="ARIAL,GENEVA,HELVETICA">  

One caveat is that there are multiple versions of DivX 5.  There is a "Pro" version 
(although no video professionals actually use DivX) that costs money and adds some 
additional features, most of which are rather trivial.  There is a free version which is 
bundled with adware as well as a free version that doesn't have adware, although sites 
that offer DivX 5 often place the non-adware version in an inconspicuous spot, so be 
careful.  Also, both DivX 4 and DivX 5 are MPEG-4 compliant, while DivX 3 was not.

</font></p><p>

<font face="ARIAL,GENEVA,HELVETICA"><b>Quality:</b>  <i>Excellent.</i>  While at high bit rates the quality is comparable to previous DivX 
versions as well as Microsoft's MPEG-4 codecs, at very low bit rates the quality of DivX 
5 is quite a bit better.

</font></p><p>

<font face="ARIAL,GENEVA,HELVETICA"><b>Size:</b>  <i>Very Good.</i>  The downside of DivX 5 is that it is not as efficient as either DivX 3 or 
Microsoft MPEG-4.  Even at moderate bit rates, the file sizes of DivX 5 videos can be as 
much as four times larger as the other codecs.

</font></p><p>

<font face="ARIAL,GENEVA,HELVETICA"><b>Compatibility:</b>  <i>Fair.</i>  DivX 5 is not as widespread as DivX 3, so its even more likely that 
users will not have the codec and be required to install it before watching DivX 5 content.

</font></p><p>

<font face="ARIAL,GENEVA,HELVETICA"><b>Usability:</b>  <i>Very Good.</i> DivX 5 provides much more controls that DivX 3 did, although most of 
them have little effect and rarely need to be tweaked.  Because of these additional 
controls, it can be a bit confusing to use DivX 5.  The most crucial setting (and probably 
the only one you'll ever need to change) is the quality setting, for which you can either 
enter a specific bit rate (up to 10000 kbps) or use a quality-percentage slider.

</font></p><p><font face="ARIAL,GENEVA,HELVETICA"><br>

<a name="xvid"></a>
</font></p><h3><font face="ARIAL,GENEVA,HELVETICA">XviD</font></h3><p>
<font face="ARIAL,GENEVA,HELVETICA">This much-hyped codec is rapidly gaining in popularity, and while it is a promising 
codec, sadly it is not quite ready for primetime.  XviD is another entry in the family of 
MPEG-4 codecs, and it and DivX 5 both have their origins in the same project.  But 
while DivX 5 turned commercial, XviD stayed open source.  Its open source nature is a 
big reason for its popularity, yet it also poses some possible problems.  Currently there 
are two XviD codecs available, both of which are very similar (Koeppi's and Nic's, 
apparently Koeppi's is a little faster but I haven't tested this).  There is a danger that 
multiple development paths can arise, causing multiple XviD codecs and possible 
confusion in the future.

</font></p><p>

<font face="ARIAL,GENEVA,HELVETICA">But the main downside to XviD is that, in its current state, it's a bit flaky.  It sometimes 
does not work well with Windows Media Player on some machines, and other players 
can have other weird problems, such as not playing sound.  XviD's level of compatibility 
seems to vary with every machine, making it a bit of a risky choice for wide distribution.

</font></p><p>

<font face="ARIAL,GENEVA,HELVETICA">XviD provides quality generally comparable to the other MPEG-4 codecs, although the 
quality can take a significant hit at low bit rates.  The quality is worse than DivX 5, yet 
you can get a much smaller file size with XviD.  There are also some weird artifacts at 
low bit rates that seem endemic to XviD (see below).

</font></p><p>

<font face="ARIAL,GENEVA,HELVETICA"><b>Quality:</b>  <i>Good/Very Good.</i>  At higher bit rates the quality is excellent and pretty much 
indistinguishable from other MPEG-4 related codecs.  However, at very low bit rates 
(under 500 kbps) there are some quality issues.  One issue is that on complex scenes there 
is often a grainy, almost pixilated, pattern to the image; it's a bit like you're watching the 
video through a screen door.  Also, shots with a great deal of motion may not have 
constant quality throughout the scene.  The shot may start out looking fine but the quality 
will then degrade with time.  Strangely, I've also seen the opposite happen, with the 
quality getting better with time.  Either way, it is distracting to have the quality 
noticeably change during the same shot.  A plus is it allows for two-pass encoding, which 
can yield higher quality results.

</font></p><p>

<font face="ARIAL,GENEVA,HELVETICA"><b>Size:</b>  <i>Excellent.</i>  Better than DivX 5, and comparable to MS MPEG-4 and DivX 3.

</font></p><p>

<font face="ARIAL,GENEVA,HELVETICA"><b>Compatibility:</b>  <i>Fair.</i>  The big problem with XviD is its unpredictable playback.  I have 
tested playback on several Windows machines: on some machines XviD files play 
perfectly in Windows Media Player, other machines gave me problems with the same 
version of Media Player.  I was sometimes forced to download a different player to play 
back the files, and even then some players worked on some machines and then not on 
others.  XviD seems to be rather finicky, which is not good if you want to distribute your 
video widely.  Also, XviD will require the user to download and install the codec, but a 
plus is that since the codec is open source, you know that this download will be free of 
both charge and restrictions.

</font></p><p>

<font face="ARIAL,GENEVA,HELVETICA"><b>Usability:</b>  <i>Good.</i>  XviD gives a bunch of parameters to tweak, but they are laid out in a 
confusing manner.  For example, to do a two-pass VBR encode, one must first select 
"First Pass," set the options, then return to the first screen and select "Second Pass," then 
pick the options for the second pass.  It is a bit non-intuitive.  Also, many of the 
parameters will never have to be tweaked by most people.

</font></p><p><font face="ARIAL,GENEVA,HELVETICA"><br>

<a name="3ivx"></a>
</font></p><h3><font face="ARIAL,GENEVA,HELVETICA">3ivx</font></h3><p>
<font face="ARIAL,GENEVA,HELVETICA">Yet another MPEG-4 codec.  Not surprisingly, its quality is comparable to the other 
DivX/MPEG-4 codecs out there, especially at high bit rates.  It falls between DivX 5 and 
XviD in quality, with its quality noticeably better than XviD at lower bit rates.  Another 
strength is that the 3ivx codec is available for a wide array of platforms.  However, 3ivx 
lags far behind in popularity when compared to the other MPEG-4 codecs, and while it is 
easy to use, it also doesn't offer many encoding options.  It's really not a bad codec, but it 
is a bit redundant, which unfortunately limits its use.

</font></p><p>

<font face="ARIAL,GENEVA,HELVETICA"><b>Quality:</b> <i>Very Good.</i>  Better than XviD, DivX 3, and MS MPEG-4.  Not as good as DivX 
5.

</font></p><p>

<font face="ARIAL,GENEVA,HELVETICA"><b>Size:</b> <i>Excellent.</i>  Comparable to MS MPEG-4, XviD, and DivX 3.  Smaller file sizes than 
DivX 5.

</font></p><p>

<font face="ARIAL,GENEVA,HELVETICA"><b>Compatibility:</b>  <i>Very Good.</i>  Since this codec is not widely used, a user who wishes to 
view a 3ivx file will likely have to download the codec.  However, the codec is available 
for a many platforms, including not only Windows and Mac, but also multiple flavors of 
Linux, Unix and even Amiga!  Also, the 3ivx codec download include both an AVI and a 
Quicktime codec.

</font></p><p>

<font face="ARIAL,GENEVA,HELVETICA"><b>Usability:</b>  <i>Good.</i>  The options are a bit skimpy (only two parameters you can set), so 
there's not much you can do to control the quality.  However, this does make the codec 
very easy to use, and the quality is usually good enough that a novie can get good results 
pretty easily.  Note that the data rate is measured in kilobytes per second, rather than 
kilobits per second, which is more commonly used by codecs.

</font></p><p><font face="ARIAL,GENEVA,HELVETICA"><br>

<a name="ind5"></a>
</font></p><h3><font face="ARIAL,GENEVA,HELVETICA">Indeo 5.10</font></h3><p>
<font face="ARIAL,GENEVA,HELVETICA">Indeo 5.10 is the latest in a long line of codecs that never really became dominant.  Indeo 
5.10 isn't too good for web distribution and is mainly of interest for games and CD-ROM 
distribution.  Indeo's hook is that it supports an Alpha channel, which allows for 
transparency and compositing.  If you don't need this, then Indeo is of little use.  Indeo 
5.10 is teetering on the edge of obsolesce, although it is still occasionally used.

</font></p><p>

<font face="ARIAL,GENEVA,HELVETICA"><b>Quality:</b>  <i>Good.</i>    Indeo 5.10's quality isn't bad, but it uses an inferior color sampling 
method that makes it prone to blockiness.  Also, a quirk of the codec is that both the 
height and width must be divisible by 4, or else the video will playback with all kinds of 
weird and undesirable effects.  This means that DV cannot be compressed at its native 
720 x 480 resolution.

</font></p><p>

<font face="ARIAL,GENEVA,HELVETICA"><b>Size:</b>  <i>Fair.</i>  Files tend to be pretty large.  In fact, its sub-par compression efficiency 
almost made me classify Indeo 5.10 as a legacy codec.

</font></p><p>

<font face="ARIAL,GENEVA,HELVETICA"><b>Compatibility:</b>  <i>Good.</i>  Indeo 5.10 is pre-installed on a fair number of Windows machine.

</font></p><p>

<font face="ARIAL,GENEVA,HELVETICA"><b>Usability:</b>  <i>Good.</i>  Not a lot of control is given, but it's not totally incomprehensible 
either.  I've rated Indeo 5.10 lower here because it has been known to behave strangely 
and has its share of quirks, such as the "divisible by four" requirement stated above.

<a name="DV"></a>
</font></p><h3><font face="ARIAL,GENEVA,HELVETICA">DV</font></h3><p>
<font face="ARIAL,GENEVA,HELVETICA">DV isn't just a tape format; it's also a compression method.  All DV camcorders and 
decks record to tape using DV compression.  When you capture DV over Firewire, you're 
not actually digitizing the video but rather simply performing a file transfer of the DV 
compressed files.  Since everything on a DV tape is compressed using DV compression, 
there is actually no such thing as "uncompressed DV," yet the term uncompressed DV is 
often casually used to refer to video that has not undergone any further compression 
besides its native DV compression.  

</font></p><p>

<font face="ARIAL,GENEVA,HELVETICA">If your footage originated on DV and was captured as Firewire, it is best to keep your 
project entirely in DV until you are finished.  Only then should you compress to another 
format, such as with a delivery codec.  By doing this you minimize any compression 
artifacts.  While DV compression is very light, compression artifacts can occur, most 
commonly "stair-stepping" on diagonal lines and "mosquito noise" near high-contrast 
boundaries.  

</font></p><p>

<font face="ARIAL,GENEVA,HELVETICA">There are several DV codecs.  Some are better than others, and some have 
restrictions.  Here are some common AVI DV codecs (note that there are some 
Quicktime DV codecs as well in the <a href="http://people.csail.mit.edu/tbuehler/video/codecs/quicktime.html">Quicktime</a> section):

</font></p><p>

<font face="ARIAL,GENEVA,HELVETICA"><b><i>Canopus DV:</i></b>  Canopus was long considered the best DV codec until the arrival of the 
Avid DV codec (a Quicktime codec).  It is still highly regarded, yet the main drawback is 
that you can only encode to Canopus DV on a machine that has Canopus hardware 
installed.  There is a software-only codec that can be installed on any machine, but it will 
only playback Canopus DV files; it will not encode with Canopus DV.  Video captured 
using the DVRaptor or DVStorm will be encoded with the Canopus DV codec.

</font></p><p>

<font face="ARIAL,GENEVA,HELVETICA"><b><i>DVSoft:</i></b>  A rather old DV codec that is pretty good.  It's main strength is that it can be 
installed on any machine and allows you to both playback and encode using DVSoft.  
DVSoft is useful if you want to encode DV files yet your machine does not have any 
video equipment or DV codecs installed.

</font></p><p>

<font face="ARIAL,GENEVA,HELVETICA"><b><i>Microsoft DV:</i></b>  Microsoft was rather late to the DV game, and their DV codec is usually 
rated rather poorly, although it has gotten better.  The main advantage is that the DV codec now ships with Windows, 
so you should only use Microsoft DV if your movie to play on many machines or if you 
are not sure if your target machine has any other DV codec installed.

<a name="huff"></a>
</font></p><h3><font face="ARIAL,GENEVA,HELVETICA">Huffyuv</font></h3><p>
<font face="ARIAL,GENEVA,HELVETICA">This is a very fast and very nice lossless codec.  Huffyuv is an ideal codec to use for 
capturing of non-DV sources.  It is also good to use for video sources that are not 
destined for DV and thus you avoid any DV artifacts.  It works in both YUV and RGB 
color space.  File sizes will be large, but not as large as they would be uncompressed.  
Huffyuv is not pre-installed anywhere, but it is a free download.

</font></p><h3><font face="ARIAL,GENEVA,HELVETICA">Avid AVI 2.02</font></h3><p>
<font face="ARIAL,GENEVA,HELVETICA">A rather strange codec, it allows for uncompressed as well as various levels of 
compressed.  Compressed is expressed through ratios rather than percentages or data 
rates (a common method within Avid products and high-end video, but rarely found 
elsewhere).  I've gotten some strange playback errors using uncompressed, and the 
compressed options are not efficient enough for this codec to be used as a delivery 
option.  Best not to use unless you are transferring material to or from an Avid system, 
and even then there are better codecs to use.

<font face="ARIAL,GENEVA,HELVETICA">Here's something you couldn't have figured out on your own:  MS MPEG v1 is the 
previous version of MS MPEG-4 v2.  In practice, you can probably see very little 
difference between the two, but there are no advantages this codec has to v2, so its best to 
go with the newer version.  There's really no need to use this codec.

<font face="ARIAL,GENEVA,HELVETICA">As stated above, this was the first legit DivX codec but was not as good as DivX 3, and 
hence didn't catch on too well.  DivX 4 has been superceded by DivX5.  In fact, if you 
install DivX 5 on a machine with DivX 4, DivX 4 will be automatically overwritten.

</font></p><h3><font face="ARIAL,GENEVA,HELVETICA">Cinepak</font></h3><p>
<font face="ARIAL,GENEVA,HELVETICA">Cinepak was at one time the standard for distribution of video via CD-ROM.  It was so 
successful that virtually every Windows or Mac machine comes with Cinepak 
preinstalled, giving it near-universal compatibility.  However, while the compatibility is 
great, Cinepak's compression technology is terribly obsolete.  Good-looking video can be 
had using Cinepak, but only with resulting file sizes that are many times larger than 
newer delivery codecs.  Cinepak only offers a quality slider for control and often takes a 
long time to encode, although the resultant file does not take much computer resources to 
play back, so it may be a possibility if you need your video to be played on older 
machines.

</font></p><h3><font face="ARIAL,GENEVA,HELVETICA">Microsoft Video 1</font></h3><p>
<font face="ARIAL,GENEVA,HELVETICA">The fact that this codec was last updated in 1992 should tell you a lot about its quality.  
You can't control the data rate, the video looks terrible, and 
the compression efficiency is so bad that when compressing a DV file, the file that has 
been "compressed" using Microsoft Video 1 is often larger than the uncompressed DV 
file!
